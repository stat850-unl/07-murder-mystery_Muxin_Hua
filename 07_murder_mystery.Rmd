## Instructions
Northwestern University's Knight lab created a SQL murder mystery to help users sharpen their database skills by solving the crime that happened at SQL city. There are tables with different pieces of information - social media checkins, people, drivers licenses, crime scene reports, police interviews, and more. 

Pick R or SAS, and solve the murder mystery, showing **all of your work in this document**. 

Your solution must be reproducible -- that is, you should use dplyr verbs, table joins, etc. to solve the mystery, rather than just looking through the tables yourselves.

You may work in groups of 2-4 people on this assignment. Each person should turn in their own assignment, but should list their group members as authors.


**For 5 bonus points, when you're finished in one language, write equivalent code in the other language to solve the problem.**

When you are finished with the assignment: 

1. Save the file as 07_Lastname_Firstname.Rmd and compile it
2. Commit the Rmd file and corresponding html file to your homework git repo
3. Push the commit to github
4. Provide the name of the guilty party in the text input field on Canvas, and make sure all of your work is on GitHub to receive full credit.


Your assignment must compile on a different computer as long as the sas path is set up correctly for that machine.

I have exported the tables as CSVs, and you can access those using the code at these links: [R](https://github.com/srvanderplas/unl-stat850/blob/master/code/06_sql-murder-setup.R), [SAS](https://github.com/srvanderplas/unl-stat850/blob/master/code/06_sql-murder-setup.sas)

The chunks below use the code to read in each of the 8 tables of data for this assignment.

Hints:

- You can use a lot of filter statements, but it will in many cases be easier to use joins. 
- See if you can write code that doesn't require you to type out knowledge gained from a previous clue (e.g. pipe your results from one query into the next)

A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a murder that occurred sometime on January 15, 2018 and that it took place in SQL City. All the clues to this mystery are buried in a huge database, and you need to use R and SAS to navigate through this network of information. Your first step to solving the mystery is to retrieve the corresponding crime scene report from the police department's database. 

This database schema may help you figure out how to navigate the database:

![sql-murder-mystery database schema diagram](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/sql-mysteries/blob/master/schema.png?raw=true)

## R
```{r db-setup-r, eval = F}
# you can do the assignment using the database, if you want, 
# or you can use the script file to read in each table separately.
library(RSQLite)
library(DBI)

# Your database connection code goes here. Store the connection as con 
con <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "sql-murder-mystery.db")
```

```{r table-setup-r}
if (!"purrr" %in% installed.packages()) {
  install.packages("purrr")
}
# Load all tables from CSV
table_names <- c("crime_scene_report", 
                 "drivers_license", 
                 "facebook_event_checkin",
                 "get_fit_now_check_in", 
                 "get_fit_now_member", 
                 "income", 
                 "interview",
                 "person")

url_base <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srvanderplas/unl-stat850/master/data/sql-murder/"

# For each table name, read the tables in and store them as the name of the table
purrr::walk(table_names, function(x) {
  assign(x, readr::read_csv(paste0(url_base, x, ".csv")), envir = .GlobalEnv)
})
```

### change the column names for join convinience
Some variables are recorded in different column names in different tables, we'll change them into identical names for convenience of performing `join` function.
```{r}
drivers_license <- rename(drivers_license, c('license_id'='id'))
person <- rename(person, c('person_id'='id'))
get_fit_now_member <- rename(get_fit_now_member, c('membership_id'='id'))
facebook_event_checkin <- rename(facebook_event_checkin, c('fb_date'='date'))
```


### Get information about the murder
The murder occurred sometime on January 15, 2018 and SQL City, so we extract such data first.
```{r}
target <- crime_scene_report %>% filter(city=='SQL City' & date=='20180115' & type=='murder')
cat(target$description)
```
There is only one crime scene report matches the date, the crime type and the location.The description says there were 2 witnesses: one of them lives at the last house on **Northwestern Dr**, and the other witness named **Annabel** lives somewhere on **Franklin Avenue**. So we'll search further information about the witnesses.  

### Trace the interview of two witnesses
Witness **Annabel** has name and address, so we use `agrep` for fussy matching of both name and address, then I `inner_join` both results to get a unique record of this witness. Then we `inner_join` with *interview* table to see is there any other information can be provided by this witness.  
The other witness has information of address, so we fussy matching the address, as he lives at the last house there, we arrange the address number in descending order and to find the largest number.  
To further verify we got the correct information of this witness, we use the information we got from last step to `inner_join` with `facebook_event_checkin` table, and see if he and Annabel share any event record. Because if they witnessed the same murder, their traveling history must have something in common. Fortunately, event record verifies the identity of this witness.  
```{r}
#Extract information about witness 1
wit_1 <-person[c(agrep('Annabel',person$name,ignore.case = T)),] %>%
        select('name') %>%
        inner_join(person[agrep('Franklin',person$address_street_name, ignore.case = T),], by='name') %>%
        inner_join(interview, by='person_id')

#Extract information about witness 2
wit_2 <- person[c(agrep('Northwestern',person$address_street_name, ignore.case = T)),] %>%
         arrange(desc(address_number))
wit_2 <- inner_join(wit_2[1,],interview,by='person_id')

#Verify the second witness is the one we're looking for, if their events matches, print “Verified, thet went to the same event”, if not matched, print "Not in the same event, further investigation needed"
print(ifelse(inner_join(wit_2, facebook_event_checkin, by='person_id')$event_id == inner_join(wit_1, facebook_event_checkin, by='person_id')$event_id, 'Verified, thet went to the same event', 'Not in the same event, further investigation needed'))
```
Now we feel safe to see what are the transcript of the witnesses.
```{r}
cat("Witness Annabel:\n", wit_1$transcript,"\n")
cat("Witness 2:\n", wit_2$transcript)
```

From the interview of the witnesses, we have following information:  
1, killer was at the gym on **January 9th**, last week.  
2, The murder commit gunshot is a man, who is a gold member of **get fit now gym**, his  **membership number** starts with **48Z** and his **car_plate** include **H42W**.  

### Identify the record of suspect
There are abundant information from witness 2, so we start finding the murderer with **member_id**, **membership status** using table *get_fit_now_member*. We verify the unique record by the **car_plate** mentioned.

```{r}
# Identify the suspect
suspect <- get_fit_now_member[c(agrep('48Z', get_fit_now_member$membership_id, ignore.case = T)),] %>%
           subset(membership_status=='gold') %>%
           inner_join(person, by='person_id') %>%
           inner_join(drivers_license, by='license_id') %>%
           select('plate_number','name.x','membership_id')

#verification, if the plate number verified the identified record, print "Verified", if not, print "Further investigation needed"
print(ifelse(agrepl('H42W', suspect$plate_number, ignore.case = T), 'Verified', 'Further investigation needed'))
```
 
Though the plate number verified the record extracted, it's safer to double check the date from the first witness.
```{r}
#verification, if the date verified the identified record, print "Verified", if not, print "Further investigation needed"
print(ifelse(agrepl('0109', as.character(get_fit_now_check_in[get_fit_now_check_in$membership_id==suspect$membership_id,]$check_in_date)), 'Verified', 'Further investigation needed'))

```

```{r}
cat('So the name of the guilty party would be: \n', suspect$name.x)
```
